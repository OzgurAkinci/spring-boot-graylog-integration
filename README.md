The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* The JVM level was changed from '11' to '17', review the [JDK Version Range](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-Versions#jdk-version-range) on the wiki for more details.
* The original package name 'com.app.spring-boot-graylog-integration' is invalid and this project uses 'com.app.springbootgraylogintegration' instead.
